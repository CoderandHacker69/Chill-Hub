Basically, umm learn how to this. Not my problem you are hungry for games :(

Uses some CDNs DONT YOU DARE SKID So yea, just use the index.html and tats it, if you wna more style if you can use the js and css

Note, this cannot be blocked becuase it uses something that almost every sso website uses I made this by myself with a little borrowing.

Also, You can embed just the html in google sites and then you have unblocked games (The index/html works just fine by itself)!
